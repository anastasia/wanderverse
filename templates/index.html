                <h4>About</h4>
                <p>
                    This is the Wanderverse Project. We hope you enjoy it. There are two ways to interact with the game:
                    as a viewer and as a contributor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Wanderverses are created when people all across the internet contribute to a poem using words found
                    around their own space. It’s a little like an Exquisite Corpse game.
                    The game is simple. At the beginning of your turn you’ll see the last two lines from a poem that is
                    in
                    play.
                    Participating means adding your own line to the poem. Adding your own line to the poem means finding
                    a
                    phrase from around your living space that you think speaks to the previous two lines. Don’t worry -
                    we’ll give you some guidance. Guidance will be found once you press “Contribute” above.
                </p>
                Let your specific prompt pull you around your house, and select a book, or a DVD cover, or a magazine or
                anything that jumps out to you. The words you select will meld back into the poem you started with. The
                next
                person to contribute will see it as part of a new set, also two lines.

                And so on and so on - it’s a chain created over time. You can see all of the poems in their full form by
                clicking “Read Poems” above.

                Don’t worry about the perfect fit! Don’t worry about changing directions! Bring your voice to the table.

                Note: This project was created at the Library Innovation Lab in partnership with the Somerville Public
                Library in Somerville, Massachusetts. It was conceived as a tool for exploring the collection of your
                local
                library, to bring a little serendipity into your visit. Now, as most of us spend our days in spaces that
                leave nothing physical to explore, we see it as an opportunity to dive into language and stories we
                already
                have around us - and to connect them with others around the web.
